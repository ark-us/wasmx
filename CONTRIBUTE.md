# Contribute

- open issues if you can clearly explain the problem, otherwise consider joining our Dicord and asking there
- don't open PRs for minor things in the `wasmx` repo (e.g. typos)
- open PRs and contribute substantial code only if you are willing to share your civil name, like the authors of this repo
- `wasmx-docs` welcomes all PRs that improve clarity, even PRs fixing typos
